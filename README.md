# Student-Grades-Blockchain
Student grades management application leveraging a peer to peer blockchain network implementation for securely storing and sharing data

Application demo video (Youtube): https://youtu.be/-usUi80MqLA

The presented application builds a peer to peer blockchain network used for storing immutable data (student points). 
The advantages of this approach are:
- data stored on the chain is immutable
- no single point of failure
- no central authority
- transparency
- automatic transaction validation
